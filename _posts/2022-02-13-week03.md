## Git Activity Reflection

<!--more-->

If I were new to Git and version control, I would be mostly satisfied with the Git Intro Activity! Prior to the activity, we were exposed to the terminology in the Version Control Systems, which I found to be very helpful. Some of the commands (push, pull, commit, diff) are straightforward, but I would have liked to have some hands-on practice on resolving merge conflicts. Once I receive the warning, I am never comfortable with dealing with them. Even when I'm watching someone else resolve a merge conflict, I am still unsure of the steps! Additionally, some more visualizations could be used. For instance, the concept of branches may be abstract if explained in words, but if an illustration was provided, I think it would be more digestable for people unfamiliar with them:

Part of my fear is due to my lack of involvement in wider-scale projects, where I am not the sole person working. Even now, I've only worked with 2 people, maximum, on the same project!

From branches, we could then work with pull requests. In retrospect, I have been working a lot more with branches and pull requests, which are really useful features to ensure that the main branch is clean. 

Another issue that some classmates had were with the SSH keys. Although I had some assistance with my setup a few years ago, I would not be able to help someone else. Perhaps, prior to the activity, there should be a preparatory assignment where students should have SSH set up? 

Otherwise, the instructions for the activity were clear and easy to follow. I learned more about the differences between clone and fork, as well as upstream.

## Jim Hall 

I really enjoyed having Jim Hall as our guest speaker, as he is both knowledgeable about old and new practices in technology! (After having many professors who are out of touch with current technology, this is very refreshing...) 

What I found particularly interesting is the fact that open-source used to commonly be adapted from closed-source works. I believe someone else asked about the legal ramifications, but there seems to be a gray area. Did companies track them down? Were open source projects seen as a threat, or did companies believe that their work could not be enhanced or replicated? At what point did the mindset transition from adapting existing technology to one where people can materialize their ideas? (as I'm trying to recall the talk, more questions begin to arise...) 

The latter half of the talk discussed the relationship of open, free, and closed software: much of which were discussed at the beginning of our course. While this was a nice refresher, I wish we could have a demo of FreeDOS! I would have liked to see the benefits of it in action.
