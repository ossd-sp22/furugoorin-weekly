## Trials and Tribulations 

During Thursday's class, Michelle and Chloe were working together to troubleshoot Docker setup, while I was finalizing on a issue to tackle first. The issue I chose is relatively simple, as it deals with file organization. Should I successfully finish working on this issue, I would ideally want to contribute to front-end or user experience. 

While waiting for a response from our submitted Google Forms, we eventually transitioned to Gitter to communicate with the project contributors. The project leader has responded to both Michelle and Chloe regarding their potential contributions, which is a great sign of a responsive community. We have all reached out regarding specific issues that we would like to be assigned, although I am still waiting for a response. I will probably send another message regarding the possibility of working with a mentor.

I am able to successfully run the necessary environment, but there does not seem to be any books locally. I will have to check with my groupmates, once they recover!
